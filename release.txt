           parser if the slash immediately follows the tag name.
         - StartTag.tidy() only included a slash before the closing delimiter
           of the tag if the tag name was in the set of

           the last character position was part of a tag.

         start of illegally nested start tag, avoiding possible stack overflow
         in the common case of multiple unterminated <a name=...> elements.
       - Tag search methods called with a pos argument that is out of range
         now return null or empty results rather than throwing an exception.
       - Renamed output(Writer) method in OutputSegment to writeTo(Writer).
       - Deprecated Tag.regenerateHTML() method.
       - Deprecated Source.getNextTagIterator() method.

2.0   (2005-11-10)
       - Complete rewrite of the parsing engine to allow the encapsulation of
         different tag types into the new TagType class.
       - Requires Java 1.4 or later.
       - All programs written for previous versions of the library will have
         to be recompiled with the new version, regardless of whether any
         changes are required.  This is because several methods, including the
         Source constructor, now expect a CharSequence as an argument instead
         of a String.
       - Changes that could require modifications to existing programs:
         - The toString() method of Segment and all subclasses now returns the
           source text of the segment instead of a string useful for debugging
           purposes.  This change was necessary because Segment now
           implements CharSequence.
         - For consistency, the toString() methods of all IOutputSegment
           implementations now return the output string instead of a string
           useful for debugging purposes.
         - The return type of the OutputDocument.getSourceText() method is now
           CharSequence instead of String.
         - Character references in Attribute.getValue() are now decoded
         - StartTag.isEmptyElementTag() no longer checks whether the end tag
           is required.
         - Element.getContent() now returns zero-length segment instead of null
           in case of an empty element.
         - FormField.getPredefinedValues() now returns an empty collection
           instead of null if the form field has no predefined values.
         - Segment.findAllStartTags() now returns server tags that are found
           inside other tags.
         - Attributes segment now ends immediately after the last attribute
           instead of immediatley before the end-of-tag delimiter.
         - Modified Segment.isWhiteSpace(char) to match HTML specification
         - CharacterReference.encode(CharSequence) no longer encodes
           apostrophes by default
         - Tags of type SERVER_COMMON now always have the name "%" regardless
           of whether an identifier immediately follows it.
         - Modified and enhanced aspects of StartTag searches relating to
           special tags
         - P elements are now terminated by TABLE elements.
           See the HTMLElementName.P documentation for more information.

       - removed Source.getSourceTextLowerCase() method deprecated in 1.3

       - Added getDebugInfo() to Segment and all subclasses to replace the
         previous functionality of the toString() method
       - OutputSegment interface now implements CharSequence
       - Added getDebugInfo() to the OutputSegment interface to replace the
         previous functionality of the toString() method
       - Attributes class now implements List
       - FormFields class now implements Collection
       - Added HTMLElementName interface and HTMLElements class
       - Added RowColumnVector class and associated methods in Source class
       - Added FormControl class
       - Added various methods to the FormField, FormFields and OutputDocument
         classes related to FormControl objects and the manipulation and output
         of form submission values.
       - Added Config and related classes
       - Added TagType class and subclasses

         - Unnamed StartTag search did not find a comment if the search starts
           at the first character of the comment
         - Character references in FormField.getPredefinedValues() items were
           not decoded
         - FormControlType.SELECT_SINGLE.allowsMultipleValues() returned false
           instead of the correct value of true, resulting in the same
           incorrect value from FormField.allowMultipleValues() when multiple
           SELECT_SINGLE controls with the same name were present in the form

          Segment.findAllElements()
       - Added hashCode() method to Segment class
       - Server tags such as ASP, JSP, PSP, PHP and Mason are now recognised
       - Basic parser logging introduced (see Source.setLogWriter() method)

       - Improved caching

1.1   (2004-03-07)
